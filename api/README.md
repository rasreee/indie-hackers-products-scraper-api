# Indie Hackers Products Scraper API

## What I used

- Axios: Get the HTML content of a page through the URL.
- Puppeteer: Parse the HTML content to retrieve the data needed.
- Mongoose: Store the data extracted into a MongoDB database
- Express: Create an endpoint that returns languages stored in the database in a JSON format.
